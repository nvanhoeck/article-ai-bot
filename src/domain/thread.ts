/**
 * Step 4: Create a thread
 * You can also attach files as Message attachments on your thread. Doing so will create another vector_store associated with the thread, or, if there is already a vector store attached to this thread, attach the new files to the existing thread vector store. When you create a Run on this thread, the file search tool will query both the vector_store from your assistant and the vector_store on the thread.
 *
 * In this example, the user attached a copy of Appleâ€™s latest 10-K filing.
 *
 * node.js
 *
 * node.js
 * // A user wants to attach a file to a specific message, let's upload it.
 * const aapl10k = await client.files.create({
 *   file: fs.createReadStream("edgar/aapl-10k.pdf"),
 *   purpose: "assistants",
 * });
 *
 * const thread = await client.beta.threads.create({
 *   messages: [
 *     {
 *       role: "user",
 *       content:
 *         "How many shares of AAPL were outstanding at the end of of October 2023?",
 *       // Attach the new file to the message.
 *       attachments: [{ file_id: aapl10k.id, tools: [{ type: "file_search" }] }],
 *     },
 *   ],
 * });
 *
 * // The thread now has a vector store in its tool resources.
 * console.log(thread.tool_resources?.file_search);
 * Vector stores created using message attachements have a default expiration policy of 7 days after they were last active (defined as the last time the vector store was part of a run). This default exists to help you manage your vector storage costs. You can override these expiration policies at any time. Learn more here.
